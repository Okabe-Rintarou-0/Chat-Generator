## SMFile_Parser
###### Stepmania File Parser for the [Stepmania Note Generator](https://github.com/cpuguy96/stepmania-note-generator) by cpuguy96 for [Stepmania](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki/sm) by VR0. Used with [Stepmania File Writer](https://github.com/jhaco/SMTXT_Converter) by me

Parses all .sm files in the `parseIn` folder by default for the following information:
- Title
- Beats-per-Minute (BPM)
- Note Timings (in seconds)
- Note Placements (ex. 0001, 0201, etc)

Writes processed data to their respective .txt files for successfully parsed .sm files to the `parseOut` folder by default.

###### Supports files with static BPM to reduce complexity in training the note generator program. Currently only reads the first difficulty found in the file.

#### Usage:
- Copy the Stepmania song folders into the input folder and run the script. The default input folder is `parseIn`.
- Successfully parsed files will be generated in the output folder. The default output folder is `parseOut`.
- If different folders are used, specify them by appending `--input inputfolder` and/or `--output outputfolder`.
  * Example: `python smfile_parser.py --input inputfolder --output outputfolder`
###### If either arguments are not specified, the scripts uses the default folder where none is specified.
###### If the specified input folder is not found, the script will print an error and terminate.
###### If the specified output folder is not found, the script will automatically generate the missing folder.
